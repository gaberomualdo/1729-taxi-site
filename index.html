    <h1>1729</h1>
    <p>The story is a well known one in academic circles.</p>
    <p>
      A young indian boy discovers God, and in the process he discovers
      mathematics. At first his work is merely encountering what existing
      scholars have known for centuries, but soon his theorems are unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramanujan is known not just for his timeless brilliance but more
      importantly for his humanity — his love of God, his desire to find
      knowledge and meaning, and his willingness to stray from a traditional
      path to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many think that people like Ramanujan only come about once in a century,
      but I'd dare to suggest they are far more common.
    </p>
    <p>There are countless brilliant thinkers and minds out there.</p>
    <p>
      The ones that become today's Ramanujans, though, are the ones that are
      willing to take the risk; the ones willing to stray from the normal path;
      the ones that care about meaning and spirit more than all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Focus on finding that meaning, for your brilliance is simply a means to an
      end.
